# SICP Notes
These are my notes and reflections on the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP) by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman. This seminal work has profoundly influenced my understanding of programming and computer science.

## Chapter 1: Building Abstractions with Procedures
- **Key Concepts**: Procedures as first-class citizens, recursion, higher-order functions.
- **Reflections**: The idea of treating procedures as first-class citizens opened up new ways of thinking about code organization and reuse. Recursion, in particular, challenged my initial understanding of iteration.
- **Example**: Implementing the factorial function using recursion and higher-order functions.
```scheme
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```
## Chapter 2: Building Abstractions with Data
- **Key Concepts**: Data abstraction, pairs, lists, and trees.
- **Reflections**: Learning to separate data representation from data manipulation was a significant milestone. It allowed me to create more flexible and maintainable code.
- **Example**: Creating a simple data abstraction for rational numbers.
```scheme
(define (make-rat n d)
  (cons n d))
(define (numer r)
  (car r))
(define (denom r)
  (cdr r))
```
## Chapter 3: Modularity, Objects, and State
